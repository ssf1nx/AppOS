# AppOS
But it's not an OS?

# What is it?
Honestly, it doesn't have much of a realistic use at the moment. I have been using it mainly as a source of practice in the Python language.

# Features
## User account creation
You create a user account that has a username and a password. It even saves across executions!

## User account editor
After creating your account, you can change its username and/or password at any time!

# (Possible) Upcoming Features
## Colored Text
## Multiple Users
## Developer Tools Built-In

# Suggestions are highly encouraged!
I need ideas for what to add to this program to make it more useful or for it to simply have a decent purpose, so please, give me some ideas!
